        <h3>Spring</h3>
        <p>
            Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. 
            There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. 
            When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. 
            </p>
        <p>
            At the spring equinox, also called the vernal equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the summer solstice.
            The spring equinox is in March in the Northern Hemisphere and in September in the Southern Hemisphere, while the summer solstice is in June in the Northern Hemisphere and in December in the Southern Hemisphere.

        <h3>Summer</h3>
        <p>
            Summer or summertime is the hottest and brightest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn.
            At or centred on the summer solstice, daylight hours are the longest and darkness hours are the shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. 
            The earliest sunrises and latest sunsets also occur near the date of the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. 
            When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
